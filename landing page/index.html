                        <P>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.</P>


                        <p>During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention.</p>

                <P>This year alone, Nepal has already witnessed nearly 5,000 wildfires â€” the second worst since records began in 2002 and second only to its 2021 fire season, when the country recorded more than 6,300 outbreaks. More than 100 people have died from wildfires in the past 12 months. Kathmandu was engulfed in hazardous wildfire smog for days on end.</P>

                    <h4>Alerts</h4>
                    <p>A satellite-based alert system could prove a potent weapon in the fight against deforestation. As few as eight hours after it detects that trees are being cut down, the system will send out e-mails warning that an area is endangered. That rapid response could enable environmental managers to catch illegal loggers before they damage large swathes of forest.</p>
